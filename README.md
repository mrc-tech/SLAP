# SLAP
Simple Linear Algebra Package (SLAP)

## Features
- Written in `C` for maximum compatibility among various systems
- Small enough to fit inside **MS-DOS** (and eventually other embedded systems)
- No external libraries (all in one header file)
- Tailored to be used in Finite Element software


# ToDo
- simple script that buld an ASCII file assessing the internal header-files structure (do inside the `header_merger`?)
